# Student Graduation Analysis

Machine learning analysis project focused on student graduation prediction and data visualization.

## Files

- `nntest.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `1.csv` - Student dataset (first data file)
- `2.csv` - Student dataset (second data file)
- `correlation.png` - Correlation analysis visualization
- `student_distribution.png` - Student data distribution plot

## Features

- Student graduation prediction modeling
- Data correlation analysis
- Statistical visualization
- Interactive Jupyter notebook analysis

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook
